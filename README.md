Oregon 2020 is a bird abundance data set which reportsthe counts of different species of birds observed during bird watching surveys. The countsof specific birds are reported by professional researchers and citizen scientists.  Each rowconsists of a checklist ID which uniquely identifies a bird watching trip and the countof birds observed during the trip.  

The land cover composition information present in the Oregon 2020 data set was usedto  predict  the  presence  and  absence  of  specific  birds  at  a  site.   This  is  a  challengingmachine learning classification problem since the presence of a bird depends greatly onthe  environmental  characteristics  of  the  area.
